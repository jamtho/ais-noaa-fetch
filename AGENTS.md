## Package management
- Always use `uv` for package management and running scripts (e.g. `uv run`, `uv add`)
- Do not use pip, conda, or other package managers

## Code style
- Use comprehensive type hints in all Python code (function signatures, return types, variables where helpful)
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` for modern annotation syntax

## Commits
- Write commit messages as a human developer would
- Do not add "created with claude", "generated by AI", or similar attributions to commit messages
